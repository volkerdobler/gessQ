# gessq README

This is my first try to write a vscode extension.
I am programming research scripts in the language gess.Q.
Therefore I need a language definition for gess.Q, which is from www.gessgroup.de

## Features

This language includes important snippets, syntax highlighting and symbol definitions within a script.
It also works for F12 (Go to definition or Find all References) and "Go to symbol" (CTRL-T)

## Extension Settings

Currently, no settings are supported

## Release Notes

It's still in an alpha version mode. See CHANGELOG.md for detail steps of versioning.

## Contributors üôè

A big thank you to the people who have contributed to this project:

* Sebastian Zagaria (improved syntax highlighting)

**Enjoy!**
